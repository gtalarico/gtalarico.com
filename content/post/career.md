Changing Careers

As teenager
When was in my early teens, years old I asked my parents to buy me "Visual Basic" for dummies.




Every once in a while I receive messages from fellow architects who are trying to make a career change
and are looking for advice.


Architechie


1. Hone Skills (You know how to do something)
2. Build Credentials/Credibility (Demonstrate to others what you are capable of)
3. Expand your network
